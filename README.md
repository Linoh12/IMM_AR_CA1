# IMM_AR_CA1
This is what I did for my Immersive Media (IMM) elective module CA1 in June 2023. 

**Application(s) Used:** GIMP, Meta Spark Studio 

**Note: *I am just a beginner using the Meta Spark Studio Software and I was mainly experimenting & playing around with it. Please don't take this project too seriously and treat it more like a fun-side project that I did for fun. Enjoy!***
